# System Architecture & Deployment Strategy 🏗️

This document details the **Hybrid Cloud Architecture** used in SariCoach to deliver a production-grade AI application.

## 1. The "Hybrid" Approach

We split the application into two distinct infrastructure layers:

| Layer | Provider | Spec | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **Vercel** | Edge Network | Hosting the React SPA, static assets, and handling SSL termination. |
| **Backend** | **DigitalOcean** | Droplet (8GB RAM) | Hosting the FastAPI Python service, running the AI Agents, and processing DataFrames. |
| **Database** | **Supabase** | Pro Plan | Managed PostgreSQL storage with `pgbouncer` for connection pooling. |

### Why not all Serverless?
AI Agents are stateful and memory-intensive. Loading a retail dataset into Pandas and generating context for an LLM often exceeds the **250MB Memory** and **10s Execution Time** limits of standard Serverless Functions (AWS Lambda / Vercel Functions).

By moving the "Brain" to a dedicated Droplet, we get:
*   **Persistent Memory:** Agents can keep dataframes in RAM.
*   **Long Timeouts:** Complex reasoning chains can take 30s+ without crashing.
*   **Full Control:** We can install system-level dependencies (like `tesseract` or `ffmpeg` in the future).

## 2. The Secure Proxy (Networking)

A major challenge in Hybrid apps is **Mixed Content**. The Frontend is HTTPS (Vercel), but the Backend Droplet is often HTTP (unless you manage certs). Browsers block HTTPS -> HTTP requests.

**Solution: Vercel Rewrites**

We use Vercel's edge network as a reverse proxy. The browser talks *only* to Vercel (HTTPS), and Vercel tunnels the request to our Droplet (HTTP) over the backbone network.

**Configuration (`vercel.json`):**

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "http://188.166.237.231:8000/api/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Flow:**
1.  User requests `https://saricoach.vercel.app/api/coach/ask`
2.  Vercel accepts the request (Secure).
3.  Vercel rewrites it to `http://188.166.237.231:8000/api/coach/ask`.
4.  Droplet processes it and responds.
5.  Vercel relays the response to the user.

## 3. Backend Infrastructure (DigitalOcean)

The backend runs on a standard Ubuntu 22.04 Droplet.

*   **IP:** `188.166.237.231`
*   **Process Manager:** `nohup` (Simple background process)
*   **Server:** `uvicorn` (ASGI)

**Deployment Command:**
```bash
nohup uvicorn service.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
```

This keeps the API alive even after SSH disconnects.

## 4. Data Layer (Supabase)

We use **Supabase** as a managed Postgres provider.

*   **Connection Pooling:** Enabled (Port 6543). This is critical because Serverless frontends (or even our multi-worker FastAPI) can open too many direct connections.
*   **Schema:** Defined in `supabase/schema/`.
*   **Seeding:** We use `seed_saricoach_data.py` to generate synthetic retail data (Transactions, Shelf Vision, STT) and push it to the DB.
